            <h3>Drone Swarm Coordination System</h3>
            <p>I'm currently involved in developing a drone swarm coordination system. This project aims to enhance the efficiency and safety of multiple drones flying together autonomously. We're exploring algorithms that allow drones to communicate and collaborate in real-time, adapting to dynamic environments without human intervention. Our goal is to revolutionize applications in search and rescue missions, agriculture, and infrastructure inspection.

            <h3>Virtual Reality Cockpit Interface</h3>
            <p>Another project I'm working on is the development of a virtual reality (VR) cockpit interface for training purposes. This immersive system replicates the experience of flying different aircraft models in various scenarios. We're integrating realistic controls and feedback mechanisms to provide trainees with a hands-on learning environment without the need for actual aircraft. Our ongoing exploration includes refining simulations and incorporating AI-driven scenarios to enhance training effectiveness.
